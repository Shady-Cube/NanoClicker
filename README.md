If you are concerned because you think this might be a virus [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/cd3428948e99eaff7f35f2fa80d7ac1b4c0540234f35cfd7c765eb9fd3fb4fa4/detection) is the VirusTotal result. It got detected by 5/72 engines because the self destruct function deletes a file in the prefetch folder.
